How each anime adaptation scales up:
* **Chaos;Head**: Widely regarded to be one of the worst visual novel to anime adaptations. Condenses the story and rushes through it, adds anime-only filler, removes many vital plot points, and has a few things out of order. Avoid unless you've read the VN and want to see how bad it is. 
* **Steins;Gate**: A faithful adaptation. Mostly cuts what it needs to in order to propery tell the story. However, it cuts a few plot points as well as ties to Chaos;Head and the rest of the Science Adventure series, making it slightly more difficult to understand its connection to the rest of the series.
* **Robotics;Notes**: Somewhat decent as a standalone entry, but bad as an adaptation. Its flaws include cutting major plot-relevant ties to Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate, as well as rushing the second half of the story and messing with the protagonist's characterization. It's not bad enough to be considered offensive, but if you have a choice, read the VN as a first experience.
* **Chaos;Child**: Known to be a bad adaptation. The story is around 40-50 hours, and is crushed into 12 episodes (around 4 hours). It shelves many story-relevant characters into being background characters who are difficult to care about in that span of time, gives extremely poor delivery of plot twists, and leaves several mechanics unexplained. 
* **Steins;Gate 0**: Steins;Gate 0 is an outlier here; it is not intended to be an adaptation of the story, but is instead intended to be the "final path" to the visual novel. While it is possible to understand it as an anime-only, there are various points that are brought up and never expanded on (which are expanded on in the visual novel). 
* **Occultic;Nine**: Occultic;Nine's anime rushes through the first few episodes, but calms down later. As the Occultic;Nine source material (light novel, not visual novel) are not finished, there is an anime-original ending. Occultic;Nine's anime was made before the retcon to include it in the Science Adventure series, so there are zero true connections to the main series.
